Banana Brawl: A platform fighter in ~1500 lines of code. This is an old project I made in my junior year of high school, but it still holds up!

## History

Anyway, after finishing the game in the summer of 2022, I spent the next eight months making sequel with online multiplayer: [Banana Brawl Bonanza](https://github.com/gbkorr/Banana-Brawl-Bonanza). I got everything working with a great codebase, but never got around to fleshing it out into an actual game...
